		<p style="margin:25px">Every month, flasks of air are collected at a worldwide network of stations and sent to the Earth Systems Research Laboratory in the U.S. for analysis. The data files of CO2 concentrations that ESRL produce are updated every month as new data comes in from the network of monitoring sites. It is this data that we use to estimate the current global CO2 level. Increasing the CO2 content of the atmosphere means that it retains more of the earth's heat. Rising CO2 levels mean that the world is getting warmer.</p>
